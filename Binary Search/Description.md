Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

 

Example 1:


```
Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
Output: 4
Explanation: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4
```


Example 2:


```
Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: 2 does not exist in nums so return -1
```


 

Constraints:



* 1 &lt;= nums.length &lt;= 104
* -104 &lt; nums[i], target &lt; 104
* All the integers in nums are unique.
* nums is sorted in ascending order.
