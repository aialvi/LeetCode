Given an integer x, return true if x is palindrome integer.

An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.



* For example, 121 is a palindrome while 123 is not.

 

Example 1:


```
Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
```


Example 2:


```
Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```


Example 3:


```
Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```


 

Constraints:



* -231 &lt;= x &lt;= 231 - 1
